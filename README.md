# 🛍️ VPlaza – Student Online Marketplace
 
VPlaza is a modern, student-focused e-commerce platform that enables buyers and sellers within campuses and student communities to trade goods and services in a fast, affordable, and trusted way.
 
 
💡 Inspiration & Vision
 
VPlaza was born from the need to create a safe, student-led buying and selling space on Nigerian campuses, where physical marketplaces are often chaotic or inaccessible. We believe that students deserve a clean, trustworthy, and mobile-friendly digital market.
